Are you curious about your financial health? In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to calculate your net worth using a simple Google Sheets template.

### Understanding Net Worth
Your net worth is essentially a snapshot of your financial health at a specific point in time. It represents the difference between your assets and liabilities. Assets are anything of value that you own, such as cash, investments, real estate, and personal belongings. Liabilities, on the other hand, are debts or obligations, including loans, mortgages, and credit card balances. By subtracting your total liabilities from your total assets, you arrive at your net worth.

Total Your Liabilities: Sum up the balances of all your liabilities to calculate your total liability amount.

Calculate Your Net Worth: Once you have your total assets and total liabilities, subtract the total liabilities from the total assets. The result is your net worth.
